Building a simple frontend clone of the AirBnB website using React.js.

Currently in the process of turning this from a one page front-end clone of the AirBnB home page into a full stack MERN AirBnB clone. Check back in later to see the fully functioning app!

Through this project I learnt to:

1. Create custom react components.
2. Create and use props with custom components.
3. Condistionally render to display/hide components based on meeting specific conditions.

Future enhancements/features to be added:

1. Connect to a database to allow displaying activities from an API call.
2. Setting up a backend for this clone.
3. Adding more pages that redirect to an activity booking page like the real AirBnB.
4. Basically turn this into a full stack clone of AirBnB.
